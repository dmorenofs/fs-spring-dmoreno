Each exercise is done in its respective branch. If it's necessary to make corrections, they will be made in new branches with the identifier v2, v3... For example, exercise 1 was done in the branch "Ejercicio1", if in the future it is necessary to correct things, the improvements will go in "Ejercicio1v2"

Also, for the sake of simplicity, each exercise is highlighted in the code itself with annotations

The object model is replaced with "User" instead of "Persona" in this exercises, and "DNI" is replaced with "userId"

Added to the proyect "Ejercicio 4":
1-Show the data from an user in the list.
2-Remove the user using the DELETE rest method
3-Check that the user is no longer in the user list


Note: Check that the UserController file starts with an Uppercase U, otherwise the proyect will give errors
