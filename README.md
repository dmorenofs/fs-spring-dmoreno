Each exercise is done in its respective branch. If it's necessary to make corrections, they will be made in new branches with the identifier v2, v3... For example, exercise 1 was done in the branch "Ejercicio1", if in the future it is necessary to correct things, the improvements will go in "Ejercicio1v2"

Also, for the sake of simplicity, each exercise is highlighted in the code itself with annotations

The object model is replaced with "User" instead of "Persona" in this exercises, and "DNI" is replaced with "userId"

Note: Check that the UserController file starts with an Uppercase U, otherwise the proyect will give errors
