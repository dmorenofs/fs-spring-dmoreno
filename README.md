## Branch "TodosEjerciciosJPA" contains the last version of all exercises (JPA)


## Branch "TodosEjercicios" contains the last version of all exercises (Spring)
If you want to see them in chronological order (the way they were done, only the Spring part, not JPA) read the last paragraph below, but bear in mind that those branches could be outdated.

Also, for the sake of simplicity, each exercise is highlighted in the code itself with annotations.


## The following text corresponds ONLY to Spring Course (Not JPA):

The object model is replaced with "User" instead of "Persona" in this exercises, and "DNI" is replaced with "userId"

Added to the project UserControllerTest
Added to the project UserService (interface) and UserServiceImpl (implementation class)
Added to the proyect "Ejercicio 4":
1-Show the data from an user in the list.
2-Remove the user using the DELETE rest method
3-Check that the user is no longer in the user list

Note: Check that the UserController file starts with an Uppercase U, otherwise the proyect will give errors

Each exercise was initially done in its respective branch. As I progressed further into the course, I realised that there were improvements/fixes that involved serveral if not all exercises, so it is not recommended to review the exercises this way, as their initial(branch) state differs greatly from the final state in "TodosEjercicios"
